Static and Dynamic Testing

Static and dynamic testing are both integral to any software developer's toolkit. Static testing takes less resources. It is defined as testing any work product or software element before deployment, or in more simple terms, testing a work product or line of code before running that code. A work product is not necessarily code, but can include things like specification documents, design charts, user stories, design specifications, and code. A work product is essentially just anything written down that is part of the SDLC.
Static tests are enacted and follow review processes, which involve many team members throughout the chain of software development and can be either formal or informal. Many roles and responsibilities conduct these reviews together. This can include: Author, manager, facilitator, review leader, reviewers, and a scribe. (1)
	So static testing clearly is taken seriously. It is one of the most important aspects of any software engineering project and is very necessary to ensure that by the first deployment we have something that is semi-functioning well, it be a blueprint or a first draft.
The most important thing to remember in reference to static testing is that the earlier any test is conducted within a process or cycle, the more efficient and the fewer resources are required. Obviously, there are different frameworks for software development from Agile to Scrum to the Waterfall method. Many of the areas in which these differ have to do with the timing of tests. Tests are typically enacted throughout each deployment cycle rather than all at once, but it is nearly always better to conduct static tests as early as possible
	Some examples of defects that are cheaper and less resource intensive when caught early include coding defects, design defects, deviation from standards, incorrect interface specifications, security vulnerabilities, and inaccuracies on a test basis.(2)
	In contrast, dynamic testing is testing that is conducted at the time of deployment. Meaning we are building or running a code base and testing it based on its outputs. Test design consists of several steps, including the identification of a test basis and some test conditions and the specification of test cases and test procedures. A test basis is any piece of raw code or writing on which the test is being conducted. The test conditions are the defining conditions for which we deem the test successful or unsuccessful. A test case is an individual segment to be tested, of which there are very, very many. And finally, a test procedure is the underlying algorithm or set of steps with which many tests are conducted. (3)
	Test coverage is a statistic which specifies the percentage of a given type of testing or overall testing for the project that either has been conducted or needs to be conducted still (4)
	Black box testing is any dynamic testing that pulls directly from specification techniques such as equivalence partitioning (reducing test cases by clumping certain ranges of cases together leaving us only with a few groups to test one sample case each from as an input or output) boundary level analysis (focusing on edge cases), decision table testing (assigning actions to various conditions or cases including combining multiple actions and conditions), state transition testing (accounting for what to do with inputs that may change their state with certain events or sequences of events), and use case testing (designing test cases based on process flows within a business).(5)
	After reading some basic introductory material on static and dynamic testing, and the processes and complexities surrounding these, I have more confidence for tackling material yet to come and I anticipate enacting real testing scenarios.
